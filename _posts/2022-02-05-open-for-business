## Maurice's blog is open for business!

I will be writing blog posts about various programming-related topics in this blog, mostly focusing on the technical aspects. In my day job, I work on Android applications and AOSP. Off work, I work on various Python scripts, Android apps, Chrome extensions, and command-line utilities, some of which are inspired by challenges I face at work.

For now, you can see a list of my published projects at: https://github.com/mauricelam
