## Welcome to Maurice's blog

I will be writing blog posts about various programming-related topics in this blog, mostly focusing on the technical aspects. In my day job, I work on Android applications and AOSP. Off work, I work on various Python scripts, Android apps, Chrome extensions, and command-line utilities.
