# How does ScrollMaps maps created using the Google Maps API?

In this blog post we will go through what I think is an interesting bit of ScrollMaps – how does it inject its event handling into maps created using Google Maps API.

If you want a higher-level background on what ScrollMaps is, and how it achieves its functionality, you can read my previous [blog post](https://mauricelam.github.io/2022/02/23/scrollmaps-origin-story.html). In that post, I mentioned that there will be another post describing how API injection works in ScrollMaps, and there are some interesting tricks employed in different versions of the ScrollMaps extension.
